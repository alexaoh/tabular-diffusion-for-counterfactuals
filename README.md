### What does this repository contain?

This repository contains all the code we have developed while working on the Master's thesis. Below we highlight the file structure and add a description of the most important files, to facilitate easier navigation for the interested reader.



# Disclaimer
We have tried to document the code as clearly as possible, but this has not been a priority during research and development. Thus, errors or inaccuracies in documentation of classes, methods, etc, are to be expected.
